# Automated-EEG-Algorithm
This repository contains the automatic and manual versions of an automated EEG algorithm developed in Matlab for detection and quantification of interictal spikes and convulsive seizures.

Automatic Code - this Matlab file is used to rapidly process EDF files containing EEG data without generating on-screen figures for analysis. The quantified data is automatically saved and exported using Microsoft Exel files.

Manual Code - this Matlab file is used to individually process EDF files containing EEG data allowing the user control over more variables and the ability to view the EEG trace with detected interictal spikes and seizures on-screen. The data can still be exported to Microsoft Excel using this code.

Most lines of code contain comments, in green, clarifying the function of the line of code and variables that can be modified to change analysis.
